## Introduction

This library provides a framework for simulating quantum circuits that are composed of Clifford gates. It includes classes to represent Pauli operators, Clifford operations, and stabilizer states. The stabilizer formalism allows efficient simulation of a subset of quantum computations that include state preparation, Clifford gates, and Pauli measurements.

### Key Components:

- Pauli Class (`ccl.Pauli`): Represents Pauli operators and supports operations like multiplication and commutation checks.
- Clifford Class (`ccl.Clifford`): Represents Clifford operations using symplectic matrices.
- StabilizerState Class (`ccl.StabilizerState`): Represents stabilizer states and supports evolution under Clifford operations and measurements.
- CliffordCircuit Class (`ccl.CliffordCircuit`): Represents a circuit composed of Clifford gates and provides methods to build and compile Clifford operations.
