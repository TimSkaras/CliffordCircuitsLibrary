# Clifford Circuits Library
Welcome to the Clifford Circuits Library! This library provides classes and methods for simulating Clifford circuits, stabilizer states, and Pauli operators using symplectic matrices. It's designed for quantum computing simulations involving Clifford operations, stabilizer states, and Pauli measurements.

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
